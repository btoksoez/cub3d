Steps:

1. The map must be composed of only 6 possible characters:
0 for an empty space,
1 for a wall
N,S,E or W for the playerâ€™s start position and spawning orientation

2. The map must be closed/surrounded by walls

3. Except for the map content, each type of element can be separated by one or
more empty line(s).

4.  The map must be parsed as it looks in the file. Spaces are a valid part of the
map and are up to you to handle. You must be able to parse any kind of map,
as long as it respects the rules of the map.
